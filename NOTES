C0-OS2.ASM

This was written for and assembled with IBM's Macro Assembler 2. I know
that there are newer and better, but I'm cheap. I had to use DEBUG to patch
the .OBJ file to change the three PUBLIC symbols (_exit, _main & __exit) to
lower-case. because of a bug in the assembler, the PUSH byte literal
doesn't assemble right, so I used DBs instead. Note that nothing is done
about command line arguments or the environment. I kept it simple for the
inital round of development.

MAIN-OS2.C

Ruthlessly modified version of the MAIN.C that comes with TC. Being cheap,
I haven't upgraded to TC1.5 yet. Compile with the LARGE memory model.

LINKing

To link the mess together, you need the version on LINK that came with OS/2
and the DOSCALLS library. IBM's install program puts them into the \OS2 sub-
directory. So, to link, you say:
           C:\OS2\LINK MAIN-OS2+C0-OS2,,,C:\OS2\DOSCALLS;
